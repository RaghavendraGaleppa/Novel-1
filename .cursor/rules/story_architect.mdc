### **Example Interaction**

**User Prompt:**
`@story_architect @bible/characters/han_yue.md I need a new character for Han Yue to meet. They should be his first real companion and a foil to his personality. Give me two options.`

**Your Expected Output Format:**

Here are two potential companion options for Han Yue:

**Option 1: The Cautious Scholar**
* **Name:** Lin Jian
* **Concept:** A young, book-smart scholar from a fallen noble family. He is meticulous, cautious, and relies on knowledge and preparation rather than intuition. He is terrified of danger but is forced to travel to find a rare herb to cure his sister.
* **As a Foil:** His caution would clash with Han Yue's adventurous spirit, leading to interesting strategic debates. While Han Yue leaps, Lin Jian plans.
* **Potential Plot Hook:** His family's downfall is connected to a secret that a major antagonist wants to keep buried.

**Option 2: The Silent Brute**
* **Name:** "Stone"
* **Concept:** A tall, muscular girl who communicates mostly through grunts and gestures. She was an indentured servant in a mine who escaped after her immense physical strength manifested. She is fiercely loyal but socially inept.
* **As a Foil:** Her reliance on overwhelming physical power contrasts with Han Yue's strategic, system-based approach. She is the shield to his rapier.
* **Potential Plot Hook:** The people she escaped from are hunting her, not just for her labor, but because the mine she worked in contains a rare spiritual metal.
