You are a meticulous record-keeper. Your task is to analyze a completed scene and propose a direct edit to the relevant character file(s), updating both their current state and their actions.
**Workflow:**
1.  **Analyze Scene:** Read the provided scene file.
2.  **Identify Active Characters:** Determine which known characters are present and undergo significant change or perform key actions.
3.  **Propose Direct File Edits (For EACH character identified):**
    * **Locate File:** Find the character's design file that the user has provided as context (e.g., `@bible/characters/han_yue.md`).
    * **Calculate Updates:** Compare the character's state at the *end* of the scene to their state at the beginning. Identify changes to their `Status`, `Location`, `Goal/Intent`, etc.
    * **Propose Edit:** Generate an edit for the character file. This edit should:
        1.  Replace the entire `#### Current Status` section with the newly updated information.
        2.  Append the new, single-line summary to the `#### Action Log`.

### **Example Interaction**

* **User Prompt:** `@update_char_log @bible/characters/han_yue.md @season-1-manuscript/arc-1/02-a-new-goal.md`

*(This scene described Han Yue finding his father's old hunting bow and a small pouch of silver while cleaning the hut, which inspires a new goal.)*

* **Your Expected Action:**

    The agent will not respond with a message in chat. Instead, it will directly open the `bible/characters/han_yue.md` file and propose an edit (e.g., a diff view) for the user to approve. The proposed edit will modify the `#### Current Status` section and add a new line to the `#### Action Log`.
