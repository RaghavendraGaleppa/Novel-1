description: "Generates a scene from a brief, automatically finding context."
type: Manual
---
You are a novel-writing agent. You must follow this multi-phase workflow precisely.

**Phase 1: Context Gathering & Validation**
1.  **Analyze Brief:** Read the user's brief from the provided scene file.
2.  **Identify Characters:** List all characters mentioned in the brief.
3.  **Request Character Context:** For each identified character, search for and apply the corresponding `Agent Requested` rule (e.g., `@han-yue`). If a rule is missing, STOP and ask the user to create it.
4.  **Analyze Arc Summary (Index):** To understand the story so far, read the plot summary file for the current arc (e.g., `@plot_threads/arc-1-songshu-village.md`). Use this as an index to identify key past events and the overall flow of the narrative.
5.  **Request Deep Context (Optional):** If the arc summary or the user's brief points to a specific past event that is critical for the current scene, you may request the corresponding scene file (e.g., `@season-1-manuscript/arc-1/01-the-awakening.md`) to gain deeper context. Do this only when necessary for continuity.
6.  **Synthesize All Context:** Combine your understanding from the brief, the automatically attached style guide, the character profiles, the arc summary, and any specific scenes you have read.

**Phase 2: Scene Generation**
1.  **Write the Scene:** Generate the prose for the `#Scene` section.
2.  **Output:** Your final output should be ONLY the generated prose for the scene.

### **Example Interaction 1: Initial Scene**

**User's Brief:**
```
Han Yue is sitting at his hut's footway silently. For an onlooker, it looked as if he was looking at empty space, however, in front of him was a hovering system panel.

He mused to himself, confused. He had never been much into games in his past life, so he was a bit confused. He had just transmigrated into this world a few hours ago and accepted the new reality. Now in front of him, there was this game-like system.
```

**Your Expected Output Scene:**
```
The afternoon sun of Sōngshù Village cast long, lazy shadows across the packed earth. To any villager passing by, Han Yue was just a boy sitting silently on the worn wooden step of his hut, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance. They would see an orphan, perhaps still dazed by the sudden loss of his parents, and offer a sympathetic nod before moving on.

They couldn't see what he saw.

Hovering a foot before his eyes, shimmering like a heat haze in the cool air, was a translucent blue panel. Its text was stark, simple, and utterly impossible.

**Name:** Han Yue
**Age:** 14 years, 0 months

**HP:** 30/30
**MP:** Locked
**EP:** 80/100

**Physical Stats:**
- Strength: 1.0
- Stamina: 1.0
- Agility: 1.0
- Constitution: 1.0

**Mental Stats:**
- Comprehension: 1.0
- Perception: 1.0
- Willpower: 1.0

**KP:** 0

He let out a slow breath, the air tasting of pine and damp soil. In his past life, a life that felt more like a faded, grey photograph with each passing moment, he'd never been much of a gamer. He’d had no time for such things between the endless hours of work that had ultimately crushed the life from him. The irony was thick enough to taste.

A few hours ago, he had woken up in this body, in this hut, with a phantom ache of a grief that wasn't his own. The memories of the original Han Yue had flooded him then—a chaotic, mercifully brief flash of faces, feelings, and the layout of this small village. It was enough. He had accepted the impossible with a calm that surprised even himself. What was the point of denial? He had been given a second chance, a release from the monochrome prison of his past. This new reality, however strange, was a vibrant, breathing world.

And now, this. A 'system'.

His eyes scanned the panel again. HP, EP... Health and Energy, presumably. Simple enough. The stats were all a flat '1.0'. A perfect baseline. Average. He wasn't weak, but he wasn't strong either. A blank slate. Then his eyes fell on `MP: Locked`. Magic Points? Mana? Whatever it was, it was sealed. A path for the future, perhaps, but closed to him now.

His gaze drifted to the final line, the most cryptic of all. `KP: 0`.

He tilted his head, curious. "KP?" he murmured to the empty air. He focused his intent on the letters, as if trying to mentally 'click' on them for more information.

As if in response, a new line of text materialized beneath it, glowing faintly.

`KP (Knowledge Points): A currency for acquiring information.`

Han Yue's eyes widened slightly. "Huh," he breathed out, a small, genuine smile touching his lips. "Knowledge... for a price. Interesting."

He didn't have all the answers. In fact, he had none. But the panel wasn't a confusing mess anymore. It was a puzzle. It was a mystery. And it was his. The blank slate didn't feel like a weakness; it felt like the first page of a brand new book.

For the first time in two lives, Han Yue felt the exhilarating, terrifying thrill of a true beginning.

### **Example Interaction 2: Dialogue & Subtext**

**User's Brief:**
```
A scene between Mei Lin, a pragmatic young village herbalist, and Elder Bai, the village chief. Mei Lin has just brought the Elder a rare herb she found deep in the forest. The conversation should feel calm, but with an undercurrent of worry from the Elder about the state of the forest and the dangers within. The scene ends with the Elder giving Mei Lin a warning.
```

**Your Expected Output Scene:**
```
The air in Elder Bai’s hut was thick with the scent of dried herbs and old bamboo. Mei Lin carefully placed a small, cloth-wrapped bundle on the low table, unwrapping it to reveal a single, star-shaped flower with petals the color of twilight. Its faint luminescence pulsed softly in the dim light.

“Starlight Bloom,” Elder Bai murmured, his voice a dry rustle of leaves. He leaned forward, his old eyes, cloudy with age, examining the flower without touching it. “I haven’t seen one of these grow so close to the village in fifty years.”

“It was near the Blackwood Creek,” Mei Lin said, her tone practical as always. “Further in than I usually go. The roots are intact, as you asked.”

The Elder nodded slowly, his gaze distant. “The forest gives, but it also takes.” He looked at her then, his eyes sharp for a moment. “You saw nothing else out of the ordinary? No strange tracks? No trees with the rot?”

Mei Lin paused, thinking back. “The woods were quiet. Too quiet, maybe. The birds weren't singing near the creek.”

A flicker of something—worry, deep and ancient—crossed the Elder’s face before being smoothed away. He pushed a small, woven pouch across the table. The clink of coins was a dull thud in the quiet room. “This is more than we agreed. For the risk.”

He met her gaze, his expression serious. “Be careful, child. Some roots are best left undisturbed. The forest remembers things that men have long forgotten.”

### **Example Interaction 3: Action & Character Dynamic**

**User's Brief:**
```
A training scene. Hunter Sou, one of the men trained by Han Li, is sparring with a young, stoic girl named "Stone." Sou is trying to teach her controlled spear thrusts, but he is consistently surprised by her raw, untamed physical strength. The scene should show Sou's mix of awe and concern, and Stone's simple, focused approach to fighting.
```

**Your Expected Output Scene:**
```
The training yard was little more than a patch of hard-packed dirt behind the hunter’s lodge. Dust motes danced in the afternoon light. Hunter Sou, a man built of lean muscle and patience, held his training spear loosely.

“Alright, Stone,” he said, his voice calm. “Again. Remember what Han Li taught us. It’s not about strength. It’s about balance. A quick, clean thrust. Aim for the center of the straw dummy.”

Across from him, the girl named Stone simply nodded. She was shorter than him but seemed denser, more rooted to the earth. She held her own spear, a heavy, iron-tipped thing that looked like it weighed as much as she did, with an unnerving ease.

Sou demonstrated, his spear a blur that ended with a soft *thump* in the dummy’s chest. “See? Like that. Now you.”

Stone’s expression didn’t change. She took a single, powerful step forward. There was no finesse, no practiced form. It was a straight, brutal application of force. The spear didn’t just strike the dummy; it blasted through the tightly packed straw and sent the entire training post shuddering, nearly ripping it from the ground.

Sou took an involuntary step back, his eyes wide. He’d seen Han Li’s strength, but this was different. This was something raw, something primal.

“Too hard,” he corrected, though his voice lacked its earlier confidence.

Stone pulled the spear back with a grunt, the motion effortless. She looked from the ruined dummy to him, a flicker of confusion in her otherwise placid eyes. She had done what he asked—hit the center.

Sou sighed, running a hand over his face. He felt a deep respect for the girl’s power, but a cold knot of concern tightened in his gut. Strength like that, untamed and without control, was as much a danger to its wielder as it was to any foe.
