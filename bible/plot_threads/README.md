# PLOT THREADS DIRECTORY INDEX

### **Purpose**

This directory serves as the central repository for tracking all the ongoing and resolved subplots, mysteries, character grudges, and long-term narrative threads within the novel. Its structured nature ensures that no storyline is forgotten and that developments are logged chronologically.

### **Directory Structure**

The directory is organized hierarchically to mirror the story's progression through different arcs.

1.  **Arc Subfolders:**
    * The `plot_threads` directory contains subfolders, each named after a major story arc (e.g., `arc-1-songshu-village/`).
    * This structure localizes plot points to the part of the story where they were first introduced.

2.  **Plot Thread Files:**
    * Inside each arc subfolder, individual `.md` files represent a single, specific plot thread.
    * The filename of each file is a short, descriptive title of the plot it contains (e.g., `mystery_of_the_whispering_cave.md`).
    * A plot thread's file is always located in the folder of the arc where it was **first introduced**, even if it continues across multiple future arcs.

### **File Content Glossary**

Each individual plot thread file contains the following information to provide a complete overview of that specific storyline:

* **Summary:** A brief description of the plot thread, its key elements, and its central question.
* **Status:** The current state of the plot thread (e.g., Active, Dormant, Resolved).
* **Sightings & Clue Log:** A chronological log detailing every scene and event where this plot thread has appeared or developed, ensuring a clear history from its introduction to its conclusion.
