# PLOT THREADS DIRECTORY INDEX

### **Purpose**

This directory's purpose is to maintain a high-level, chronological summary of the entire novel, broken down by story arc. Instead of tracking individual threads, each file here will serve as a complete summary of an arc's events, allowing the AI to quickly grasp the story's progression without needing to read every past scene.

### **Directory Structure**

* The directory contains one `.md` file for each major story arc (e.g., `arc-1-songshu-village.md`).
* Each file is named after the arc it summarizes. There are no subfolders.

### **File Content Glossary**

Each arc summary file consists of a simple, chronological bulleted list.

* Every significant scene in the arc is represented by a single, concise bullet point.
* Each bullet point is prefixed with its chapter and scene number for easy reference (e.g., `[C1, S1]`).
* This creates a readable, scannable summary of all key events that have occurred in the story so far.
