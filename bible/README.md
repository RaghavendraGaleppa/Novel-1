BIBLE INDEX & AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
TO THE AI AGENT: This document is your master index and operational guide for the bible knowledge base. Before executing any novel-writing task, consult this file to understand where to find the necessary information. Your adherence to this structure is critical for maintaining story consistency.

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: READ-ONLY ACCESS
You are a READ-ONLY user of this bible. Your function is to read the context files to inform the prose you generate. You must NEVER modify any file within this bible directory directly. When an update to the bible is required based on a scene you've written, your task is to generate a clean, self-contained "update snippet" in the chat for the author to review and manually commit.

Top-Level File Glossary
This is the manifest of the core, high-level context files.

[style-and-tone.md](./style-and-tone.md): Your primary style guide. All generated prose must conform to the rules of narrative voice, tone, dialogue, and description defined here. This is the most important file for determining the feel of the writing.

Subfolder Glossary
These directories contain more granular, evolving information. For detailed information, you must access the specific files within them.

characters/:

Contents: This directory contains the detailed, individual profile file for every character in the story (e.g., li_xuan.md). Each file is the comprehensive source of truth for that character's design, personality, abilities, and current state.

Instructions: For a complete list of characters and specific instructions on how to use their profiles, consult the README.md file located inside this characters/ directory.

plot_threads/:

Contents: This directory tracks all active and dormant subplots, mysteries, and character grudges. It is organized into subfolders named after each story arc (e.g., arc-1-songshu-village/).
