She became a beloved figure in Sōngshù Village, known for her boundless empathy. She would often provide food or clothing to families in need and served as an informal midwife, helping other women through the trials of childbirth. Her gentle nature and belief in karma made her a source of comfort for many.

She died alongside her husband, Han Li, when a sudden, raging storm caught them by a river where she was washing clothes.
