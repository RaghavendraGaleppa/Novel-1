# System Panel

### **PART I: CORE DESIGN (The Blueprint)**
*(The fundamental rules and appearance of the System. This is static.)*

**1. Core Identity**
* **Role in Story:** A game-like interface exclusive to Han Yue, granted upon his transmigration. It serves as a tool to quantify his status and provide critical information at a cost.
* **Nature:** A non-sentient, impartial tool. It does not offer advice or have its own personality; it only presents data.

**2. Appearance & Behavior**
* **Visuals:** The panel appears as a simple, translucent, blue-tinged status bar that hovers in Han Yue's vision. It is invisible and imperceptible to everyone else.
* **Interaction:** Han Yue can summon or dismiss it with a simple mental command.

**3. Glossary of Terms**
*(This section defines what each stat represents. The baseline of 1.0 for stats represents the average for a healthy, non-cultivating human of Han Yue's age.)*

* **HP (Health Points):** Represents physical vitality. Reaching zero results in death.
* **MP (Mana/Magic Points):** Represents energy for spiritual arts. **Status: Locked.**
* **EP (Energy/Endurance Points):** Represents physical stamina for non-magical actions.

* **Physical & Mental Stats:** These stats (Strength, Agility, Comprehension, etc.) are the quantification of Han Yue's physical and mental capabilities. **They can only be increased through direct, sustained effort, training, and personal breakthroughs.** The System records these changes; it does not grant them.

* **KP (Knowledge Points):**
    * **Nature:** This is a special currency, not a measure of experience. KP is earned by overcoming significant, non-repeatable challenges that push Han Yue beyond his previous limits. The amount awarded is proportional to the difficulty and significance of the achievement.
    * **Examples of Earning KP:**
        * **Mortal Triumph:** Defeating a dangerous beast (like a tiger) for the first time.
        * **Intellectual Breakthrough:** Solving a complex puzzle or mystery that others could not.
        * **Social Victory:** Successfully navigating a dangerous social or political situation through wit and courage.
        * **Discovery:** Finding a hidden location, a secret technique, or a piece of forgotten lore.
        * **Creation:** Inventing a new tool or a unique application of a skill.
    * **Function:** KP can be spent to ask the System a direct question. The System acts as a universal database, providing concise, factual answers. This is Han Yue's primary tool for strategic advantage.

* **The Q&A Mechanic:**
    * **Dynamic Pricing:** Every question has a KP cost determined by two key factors:
        1.  **The Knowledge Gap:** The cost is proportional to how far the answer is beyond Han Yue's current understanding. A simple question about local herbs might be cheap. A question about a complex cultivation theory he has never encountered will be expensive.
        2.  **Situational Criticality:** The cost scales with how immediately impactful the answer could be. Asking for the weakness of an enemy currently trying to kill him will cost significantly more than asking the same question out of idle curiosity.
    * **The "Impossibility" Cost:** The System contains answers to virtually everything, but access is gated by KP. If Han Yue asks a question that is vastly beyond his current scope, the cost will be astronomical and effectively impossible for him to pay.
        * **Example:** If, at the start of the story, he asks, "What is the complete path to immortality?", the System might respond with: `[Cost: 9,999,999,999,999 KP. Insufficient funds.]` This confirms an answer exists but is currently unattainable.
