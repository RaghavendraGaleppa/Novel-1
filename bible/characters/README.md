# CHARACTERS SUBDIRECTORY INDEX

### **Purpose**

This folder holds the profiles for every character in the story. Think of each file as a detailed dossier or a 'character sheet' that keeps track of everything about a person, from their personality to the skills they learn on their adventure. This ensures that characters act consistently and their growth is tracked accurately throughout the novel.

### **File Structure**

* Each character has their own dedicated `.md` file.
* The filename corresponds to the character's name (e.g., `li_xuan.md`).
* The amount of detail for each character is flexible. Main characters will naturally have much more extensive descriptions than minor ones.

### **File Content Glossary**

Each character file is split into two main parts to clearly separate who a character *is* from what *happens* to them. This separation is crucial for tracking their development logically.

* **Part I: Core Design (The Blueprint)**
    * **What it is:** This section describes the character as they are at the very beginning of the story. It's their foundational blueprintâ€”their personality, their history, how they look, and their place in the world.
    * **Why it's separate:** This information rarely changes. It's the solid base upon which the character's journey is built, allowing us to always reference who they were when they started.

* **Part II: The Journey (The Live Log)**
    * **What it is:** This section is a living diary of the character's adventure. It tracks everything that changes over time: their current location, their immediate goals, the new abilities they learn, the items they find, and how their relationships with others evolve.
    * **Why it's separate:** This part will be updated constantly as the story progresses, creating a detailed log of the character's growth and experiences without altering their core, initial identity.
