### **PART I: CORE DESIGN (The Blueprint)**
*(Who the character IS at the start of the story. This is static.)*

**1. Core Identity**
* **Role in Story:** Protagonist
* **Title/Alias:** None (at start)
* **Apparent Age:** 14
* **Gender:** Male
* **Origin:** A transmigrator from a modern world who died of overwork. Reincarnated into the body of an orphan in Sōngshù Village.

**2. Personality & Beliefs**
* **Core Traits:** Deeply optimistic, adventurous, kind, sympathetic, extremely sharp, intuitive, and resolute. His personality is akin to Monkey D. Luffy's from One Piece—he possesses an almost unshakeable cheerfulness and a simple, powerful drive for adventure.
* **Greatest Motivation:** To explore the vast new world and live a life of freedom and adventure. He sees his second life as a gift and intends to experience it to the fullest.
* **Greatest Fear:** Wasting his second chance. He is deeply afraid of falling back into a meaningless cycle or dying with regrets again.
* **Quirks & Habits:** Possesses a game-like system panel that only he can see and interact with. [See System Panel](./system_panel.md)

**3. Appearance & Mannerisms**
* **Physical Description:** At 14, his body is frail from a life of hardship but not extremely malnourished. He has jet black hair, sharp black eyes, and wears a simple circular ring in his right ear as a stylistic choice that makes him distinct.
* **Clothing/Style:** Simple, practical orphan's robes, likely worn and patched from use.
* **Speech Pattern:** Generally cheerful and optimistic. He is unfailingly polite and respectful to his elders or those he deems more accomplished.

**4. Background**
Han Yue is a transmigrator. In his past life, he was a man who died from severe overwork, a life devoid of joy. He awoke in the body of a 14-year-old boy of the same name in Sōngshù Village. This reincarnation feels like a profound liberation.

He has inherited a life of recent tragedy. The original Han Yue's parents, [Han Li](./han_li.md) and [Han Ping](./han_ping.md), died in a violent storm just three days before his arrival. While he feels no personal grief or attachment to them, he is respectful of the life he has inherited. Upon his arrival in the new body, he experienced a one-time flash of the original Han Yue's core memories, which served the functional purpose of helping him understand his immediate situation. These memories do not recur and hold no deeper emotional sway over him.

Before leaving the village to begin his journey, he pays his respects at the graves of [Han Li](./han_li.md) and [Han Ping](./han_ping.md) and sincerely thanks the soul of the original Han Yue for the body, seeing it as a precious gift.
