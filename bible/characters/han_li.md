**4. Background**
Han Li was the main hunter for Sōngshù Village, a man respected for his strength and generosity. During the day, he would venture into the surrounding forests to hunt, providing food for his family and the village.

He was deeply integrated into the community, often helping farmers protect or quickly harvest their crops during emergencies like storms or animal attacks. He was also a mentor, having trained three other villagers—[Uncle Li](./li_ken.md), [Hunter Sou](./sou_men.md), and [Hunter Xiao Men](./xiao_men.md)—in the use of mundane weapons like the bow and spear. This act earned him their deep gratitude and loyalty.

He died alongside his wife, Han Ping, when a sudden, raging storm caught them by a river.
