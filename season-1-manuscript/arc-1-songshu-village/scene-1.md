Han Yue is sitting at his hut's footway silently. For an onlooker, it looked as if he was looking at empty space, however, in front of him was a hovering system panel.

He mused to himself, confused. He had never been much into games in his past life, so he was a bit confused. He had just transmigrated into this world a few hours ago and accepted the new reality. Now in front of him, there was this game-like system.

# Scene

The afternoon sun of Sōngshù Village cast long, lazy shadows across the packed earth. To any villager passing by, Han Yue was just a boy sitting silently on the worn wooden step of his hut, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance. They would see an orphan, perhaps still dazed by the sudden loss of his parents three days prior, and offer a sympathetic nod before moving on with their daily tasks.

They couldn't see what he saw.

Hovering a foot before his eyes, shimmering like a heat haze in the cool air, was a translucent blue panel. Its text was stark, simple, and utterly impossible.

He let out a slow breath, the air tasting of pine and the distant scent of cooking fires. In his past life—a life that felt more like a faded, grey photograph with each passing moment—he'd never been much of a gamer. He'd had no time for such things between the endless hours of work that had ultimately crushed the life from him. The irony was thick enough to taste.

A few hours ago, he had woken up in this body, in this modest hut, with memories that weren't quite his own flooding through him like water through a broken dam. The original Han Yue's life had rushed past in a chaotic, mercifully brief flash—faces of villagers, the layout of Sōngshù Village, the ache of recent loss. It was enough. He had accepted the impossible with a calm that surprised even himself. What was the point of denial when he'd been given such a gift?

This new reality, however strange, was a vibrant, breathing world. And he was alive in it.

And now, this. A 'system.'

His dark eyes scanned the panel again, taking in each line with the methodical patience that had once served him well in his previous, mundane life. HP, EP... Health and Energy, presumably. Simple enough concepts. The stats were all a flat '1.0'—a perfect baseline. Average. He wasn't weak, but he wasn't strong either. A blank slate waiting to be written upon.

Then his gaze fell on the cryptic `MP: Locked`. Magic Points? Mana? Whatever it represented, it was sealed away from him. A path for the future, perhaps, but closed to him now. The thought didn't frustrate him—instead, it sparked a curious excitement. If it could be locked, then surely it could be unlocked.

His attention drifted to the final, most mysterious line: `KP: 0`.

Han Yue tilted his head slightly, his sharp black eyes narrowing with genuine curiosity. "KP?" he murmured to the empty air, his voice barely above a whisper. Acting on instinct, he focused his intent on those two letters, as if trying to mentally 'click' on them for more information.

As if responding to his thoughts, a new line of text materialized beneath it, glowing with a soft, pale light.

`KP (Knowledge Points): A currency for acquiring information.`

Han Yue's eyes widened slightly, and for the first time since arriving in this world, a genuine smile touched his lips. "Knowledge... for a price," he breathed out, something like wonder coloring his voice. "How fascinating."

He leaned back against the doorframe of his hut, the rough wood warm against his shoulders from the afternoon sun. The confusion that had clouded his thoughts began to clear, replaced by something far more familiar—the thrill of a puzzle waiting to be solved. He didn't have all the answers. In fact, he had almost none. But the system wasn't just a bewildering anomaly anymore. It was a tool, a guide, a pathway to understanding this vast new world that stretched out before him.

The blank slate of his stats didn't feel like weakness now. It felt like the first page of an entirely new book, one where he held the pen.

For the first time in two lives, Han Yue felt the exhilarating, terrifying rush of a true beginning.
