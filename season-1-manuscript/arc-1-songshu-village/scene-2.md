# Scene

With the system panel still shimmering in his peripheral vision, Han Yue rose from the doorstep and stepped back into the hut.

The modest interior was carefully organized. In one corner sat a bed woven from dried stalks in intricate star patterns—his mother's handiwork. Three oil lamps were positioned throughout: one hanging from the central beam, another near the kitchen corner, and a third above a small wooden table where his mother had done her sewing. Scraps of fabric and bone needles still scattered its surface.

His father's corner held practical tools: an iron-headed axe, a well-worn hoe, and a simple hunting bow with a quiver of arrows. Han Yue examined the bow with curiosity. In his past life, he'd never held anything more dangerous than a kitchen knife.

Moving to the kitchen area, he took inventory of the food stores. Potatoes, root vegetables, some leafy greens. For spices, only salt, dried Sichuan peppercorns, and a knob of ginger—simple compared to his previous world's abundance.

His stomach reminded him he hadn't eaten since arriving in this new life. After some struggle with starting a fire, he boiled the vegetables and mashed the potatoes with salt and ginger. The meal was plain but nourishing, and there was something satisfying about preparing it with his own hands.

As darkness settled over Sōngshù Village, Han Yue tidied the few dishes, banked the fire to glowing coals, and made his way to the star-woven bed. He removed only his outer robe, folding it carefully and placing it on the chair. The bed was more comfortable than he'd expected, the woven stalks providing both support and a subtle rustle that reminded him he was truly in a different world now.

Sleep came easily, carrying with it dreams of mountain paths and distant horizons.
