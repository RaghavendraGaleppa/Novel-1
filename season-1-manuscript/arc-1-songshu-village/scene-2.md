# Scene

With the system panel still shimmering in his peripheral vision, Han Yue rose from the doorstep and turned back into the hut. The wooden door creaked softly as he pushed it wider, allowing the late afternoon light to spill across the modest interior he was seeing properly for the first time.

The hut was small but carefully organized, every item speaking of lives lived with purpose and care. In the far corner sat a bed woven from dried stalks arranged in intricate star patterns—his mother's handiwork, he realized, the inherited memory surfacing without the accompanying grief. The weaving was tight and skillful, creating a surface that looked both comfortable and sturdy. Above it, thin wooden shelves held a few folded blankets, rough-spun but clean.

Three oil lamps were positioned throughout the space: one hanging from a central beam that would illuminate the main living area, another mounted near what served as the kitchen corner, and a third in the far corner where his mother had worked. The lamps were simple clay and metal affairs, practical rather than decorative, but they had been maintained with obvious care.

Han Yue's gaze drifted to the small wooden table and chair positioned beneath one of the lamps. The chair's seat was worn smooth from use, and scattered across the table's surface were remnants of the original Han Yue's mother's work—scraps of coarse fabric, a few bone needles, and thin wooden spools that had once held thread. He touched the table's edge gently, a gesture of respect for the woman who had lived and worked here, though her face remained a distant blur in his inherited memories.

In the opposite corner, his father's domain told a different story. Practical tools were arranged with the same care but spoke of harder labor—an iron-headed axe for splitting wood, a well-worn hoe for working the small garden plot behind the hut. But it was the hunting bow that drew his attention. It was a simple construction of wood and sinew, unadorned but functional, with a leather grip darkened by years of use. A quiver held perhaps a dozen arrows, their feathers slightly ragged but their iron points sharp and ready.

"A hunter," Han Yue murmured to himself, examining the bow without touching it. In his past life, he'd never held a weapon more dangerous than a kitchen knife. The idea of hunting for survival felt both foreign and oddly thrilling.

The kitchen occupied the remaining space—a collection of clay pots, wooden bowls, and a small iron cooking pot set beside a simple stone hearth. Han Yue opened the food storage vessels one by one, taking inventory of his inheritance. Potatoes, still firm despite having been stored for several days. Root vegetables—radishes, carrots, onions—that must have come from the family's garden or been traded in the village. A small cache of leafy greens that would need to be used soon before they spoiled.

The spice collection made him smile ruefully. In his previous world, his cramped apartment kitchen had boasted dozens of seasonings and flavor enhancers. Here, he found salt in a small ceramic jar, a handful of dried Sichuan peppercorns that would provide heat and numbing spice, and a knob of fresh ginger that was already beginning to soften. Simple, but honest.

His stomach gave a quiet reminder that he hadn't eaten since waking up in this new life. Han Yue set about preparing what might charitably be called a meal. He filled the iron pot with water from a large clay jar near the door, grateful to find it still fresh. The fire-starting process took longer than he'd expected—his modern life had left him woefully unprepared for such basic tasks—but eventually, small flames began to lick at the dried wood beneath the pot.

While the water heated, he cleaned and chopped the vegetables with a worn but sharp knife, his movements becoming more confident as muscle memory from the original Han Yue's life guided his hands. The potatoes went into the pot first, followed by the harder root vegetables. When everything was tender enough to pierce with the knife, he mashed the potatoes roughly in a wooden bowl, adding a pinch of salt and the smallest amount of ginger for flavor.

The boiled vegetables he left whole, seasoning them with salt and a few crushed Sichuan peppercorns that filled the small space with their distinctive aroma. It wasn't elegant, but it was warm and filling, and after a life of convenience foods and takeout, there was something deeply satisfying about the simple process of preparing sustenance with his own hands.

He ate slowly, sitting on the single chair and watching the last light of day fade through the small window. The food was plain but nourishing, and more importantly, it was his—prepared in his kitchen, with his tools, in his new life.

As darkness settled over Sōngshù Village, Han Yue tidied the few dishes, banked the fire to glowing coals, and made his way to the star-woven bed. He removed only his outer robe, folding it carefully and placing it on the chair. The bed was more comfortable than he'd expected, the woven stalks providing both support and a subtle rustle that reminded him he was truly in a different world now.

Sleep came easily, carrying with it dreams of mountain paths and distant horizons.
